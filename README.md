Objective: The goal of this project is to detect and segment brain tumors in medical images using the Mask R-CNN algorithm. The aim is to create an automated system that accurately identifies tumor regions to assist in diagnosis and treatment planning.
Results: The Mask R-CNN model successfully detected and segmented brain tumors with high precision. It achieved a strong Intersection over Union (IoU) score, demonstrating its ability to accurately outline tumor boundaries. The model also showed good generalization on unseen data, making it suitable for real-world applications.
Skills: This project enhanced skills in deep learning (Mask R-CNN), image processing, Python programming, and model evaluation. It also provided experience in working with medical imaging data and solving challenges related to model training and performance optimization.
